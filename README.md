# Python Fuel Cost Calculator
This project allows you to use your MPG data to calculate how much travelling a given distance costs you in fuel. Support for both *metric* (kilometres, litres) and *imperial* units (miles, gallons) is built-in and the program fetches the **latest fuel prices** for the United Kingdom automatically.
